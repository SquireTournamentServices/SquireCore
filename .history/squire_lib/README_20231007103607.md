## Overview
This library is the central library for all Squire Tournament Services.
Since this library is the absolute fundation of all STS, it must implement all features of tournament model while satisfying all the environmental constraints of STS clients.

## How It Works
The primary feature of the Squire tournament model is flexiblity.
We allow you to have things like arbitrary pairings size, so you can pair traditional two-player round or four-player EDH pods or eight-player draft tables or any other number your unique format requests.
We also allow for the customizing the scoring system, such as how many point a game win/loss/draw is worth.
All of this is also adjustable on-the-fly, so you can pair draft pods for stage one of your tournament and then pair two-player tables for games of Modern.

We also need to design around all of our client as well as.
Because everything in the STS ecosystem relies on a local-first model of tournament management, there are two primary constraints endused by client: discrete actions and determinism.

The discrete actions issues is fairly straightforward, any change to a tournament must be storable so it can be reproduced.
The library handles this by making all changes need to use a type called `TournOp`.
These can be cloned, (de)serialized, and passed to a tournament to cause it perform some action.

In order to create the same tournament state in any environment, the results of a tournament operation must be deterministic.
This determinism is also leveraged to be able to rollback to arbitrary points in a tournament's history.
However, only mutations need to be deterministic.
For example, getting a set of pairings does not mutable the tournament, so they could theoretically return completely random pairings of players
However, turning those pairings into rounds does mutate the tournament.
This allows for pairings to be generate somewhere and shared.

## Contributing
To contribute to the project, create branches off the repository itself (don't fork into your own namespace) and open PR's against the main branch. All PR's are subject to review. To run the project in development, execute the following commands:

cargo install cargo-shuttle
cargo install trunk // make sure to run these to installs separately
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown

## Current State
This library has been mostly stabilized; however, before it can be release for it v1.0, it needs to be tested more thoroughly for determinism.
However, the vast majority of the tournament model is implemented and will function properly for clients that are local-only.

## Future Plans
Even after full stabilization, this library will continue to grow and expand as we start to offer a more expansive range of tournament services.
For example, we do not yet offer an EOL scoring system, and that will be added.
